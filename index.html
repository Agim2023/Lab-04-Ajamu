    <main>
        <p> My name is Ajamu Page, a 45 year old father of 3, from a small town outside of New Orleans called Phoenix, Louisana.
            I am a proud graduate of Phoenix High School's State Championship Class of 1996.  I attended Oakwood University in Huntsville,
            Alabama.  I spent 12 years as an employee of Ochsner Medical Center as an Arrythmia Diagnostic Tech.  Currently, I am employed
            at the Plaquemines Parish Sheriff's Office, where I serve as the GED/HiSet instructor for the Detention Center.  My future
            career plans include becoming a Software Developer.
